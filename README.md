  * Classes are very un-balanced, with item counts spanning more than 3 orders of magnitude
  * scikit-learn and gensim
 
 * [styleTransfer](#styleTransfer/README.md)
   * Apply [Gatys *et al., *Image style transfer using convolutional neural networks*, CVPR 2016](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.html) to create images from photographs that match an artistic style.
