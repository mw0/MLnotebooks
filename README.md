## Machine Learning Notebooks

* [InterpretableML](#InterpretableML/README.md)
  * tutorial, originating from Domino Data Labs, for application of `LIME` and `shap` (Shapley values) for estimating contributions of features to a given instance prediction
* [KaggleWeather](#KaggleWeather/README.md)
  * Examples of time-series analyses applied to Kaggle weather data set
  * Includes a primer on the use of wavelet scaleograms
* [KerasProjects](#KerasProjects/README.md)
  * Multiple re-works of examples from Francois Chollet's *Deep Learning with Python*
  * Example, from Analytics Vidhya, of CNN classifier of age in actor images from film stills
* [multiClass](#multiClass/README.md)
  * Classifiers for selecting from on of 56 codes, based upon a "critical" boolean and text notes of varying length
  * Classes are very un-balanced, with item counts spanning more than 3 orders of magnitude
  * `scikit-learn` and `gensim`
* [SparkProjects](#SparkProjects/README.md)
  * Exploratory analysis of large server logs using Spark
* [styleTransfer](#styleTransfer/README.md)
  * Applies [Gatys *et al., *Image style transfer using convolutional neural networks*, CVPR 2016](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.html) to create images from photographs that match an artistic style.
* [UberReprise](#UberReprise/README.md)
  * binary classifier based upon time &Delta;s from driver sign-up date to different actions, and upon make and model of vehicle.
