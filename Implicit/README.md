## Implicit

Implicit feature-based recommendations using Implicit code.

This makes use of [Ben Frederickson's Implicit](https://github.com/benfred/implicit) very well-optimised code.
For documentation, refer to [Fast Python Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Datasets](https://implicit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

More will be included here after grid search indicates optimal results.
