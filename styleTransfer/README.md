## Making Your Transfer Stylish

**Mark Wilber**

I present here examples of style transfer using the method proposed by [Gatys, L.A., et. al., *Image style transfer using convolutional neural networks*, CVPR 2016](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.html).

Much of the code is derived, initially, from Walid Ahmad's [Making AI Art with Style Transfer using Keras](https://medium.com/mlreview/making-ai-art-with-style-transfer-using-keras-8bb5fa44b216).
